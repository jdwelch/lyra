Workflow
===
This document describes the generic semantics of a workflow in a language neutral way. See [Puppet Workflow DSL](workflow-puppet-dsl.md) and [YAML Workflow](workflow-yaml.md) for language specific declarations.

A Workflow consists of a set of activities that are either declarative or imperative in nature. A `resource` of a certain type, that maps a desired state to to a handler for that state, is an example of a declarative activity, whereas an `action` activity with a code block, is an example of an imperative activity.

A workflow, being an activity in its own right, may be used as an activity in another workflow.

## Activities

All activities consist of the following elements:

Element|Description|Mandatory
-------|-----------|------
style|one of `action`, `resource`, `state_handler`, or `workflow`|yes
properties|literal hash declaring `input`, `output`, and other properties|yes
iteration|enables multiple invocations of data or code|no
data or code|interpreted differently depending on style|no

### Common activity properties
##### input
declares a set of parameters. Each parameter has a name and optional `type` and `lookup` expressions.

###### scope
A parameter without a lookup expression must denote a variable known to the containing workflow, i.e. an `input` parameter to the workflow itself or an `output` variable from sibling activity. When a workflow contains other workflows, each workflow acts as its own closure and nested references are not allowed.

The input `type` can be omitted when the parameter maps to an output variable from other activity because the type can then be inferred from the output.

An activity will have access to the `input` that it declares, an optional iteration variable, and a predefined global variable named `$context` (see section about `$context` below). It will not have access to any other variables. The reason for this is that activities may run in a process different from the workflow engine and will be executed with the presumption that the remote process holds no state. All state must hence be passed to an activity in order for it to execute.

##### output
declares the set of named and typed variables that an activity will contribute to the workflow.

The output for a `resource` activity must always reference named attributes of its state. The `type` of such output can therefore always be inferred from the corresponding attribute and is hence optional.

An `alias` can be used when it is desirable to give the output variable a different name than the attribute it references.

##### when
declares a guard expression that must evaluate to `true` in order for the activity to participate in the workflow. A guard expression consists of names of guard activities combined using a language specific notation for `and`, `or`, and `not` and grouped using parenthesis.

Since guards will impose conditional paths in the workflow, the number of guards must be limited or the validation will become very resource consuming. The current limit is 8 guards per workflow which results in a maximum of in 2<sup>8</sup> (256) possible paths of execution. More complex workflows can be created using sub-workflows contained in a parent workflow.

##### sequential
declares that the activity must execute in a sequential manner.

Sequential setting|Meaning|Usage
-------|-------|-----
_activities_|All activities must execute in the order they are declared. It is illegal for an activity `input` to reference an `output` that is declared in a subsequent activity.|workflow only
_iteration_|Each iteration will happen in sequence. The default is to run iterations in parallel as much as possible.| iteration activities only
_both_|both _activities_ and _iteration_|workflow with iteration

#### Iteration
An iteration can be declared to iterate over `input` data or literals.

Iteration type|Description|Parameters|Variables
--------------|-----------|----------|---------
times|iterates the number of times given by count|`count` - a positive integer|`index` - an integer that starts with zero and increments up to, but not including count
range|iterates over a range denoted by two parameters|`from` - an integer, `to` - an integer greater than `from`|`index`and integer starting at `<from>` and increments up to, but not including `<to>`
each|iterates over all elements of a hash or an array|`collection` - a hash or array to iterate over|`value` - each element in the array or `key` and `value` to iterate over the associations of a hash

An activity with an iteration must be declared to produce an `output` consisting of a `key` and a `value`. This is the product of each iteration. The final output from the activity is one variable named after the activity containing a Hash consisting of the key/value pair of each iteration.

### StateHandler
A stateHandler implements a predefined set of functions (an interface) that performs tasks related to a subject. Lyra currently only defines one such interface, the CRUD, which is implemented by resource handlers and the only reason to write an action, is when there's a desire to implement a handler for a resource state.

It is expected that Lyra will add additional interfaces in the future.

### Action
An action defines an imperative function that performs some task based on its input and provides some output.

### Resource
A resource is a declaration of a desired state of some entity external to the workflow. The `<data or code>` block is a hash that defines this state. The block is described by an `Type` which is defined by a `stateHandler`, an activity that can perform `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` operations on the state.

When the workflow interacts with Resource activities, it delegates the apply of the activity to the CRUD layer which in turn consults the `stateHandler` registered for the state's `Type`. The CRUD layer will determine how to use the `stateHandler` depending on how the workflow engine was invoked.

#### Resource Attributes
##### type
The `type` is an optional type name that can be used to explicitly denote the resource type. If omitted, the type
will be inferred by concatenating the `typespace` in the parent workflow with the name of the resource.

##### external_id
an optional id that denotes the external identifier of read-only (unmanaged) resource. The intended use for this is to establish relationships between the infrastructure defined by the workflow and pre-existing infrastructure that the workflow should make no attempt to manage.

### Workflow
A workflow combines a set of activities into a process. The `<data or code>` block is code that declares those activities.

#### Workflow Attributes
##### typespace
The `typespace` declares the namespace to use when resolving type names. The `typespace` enables a `resource` to be
declared without an explicit `type`. Instead, the type is inferred by concatenating the typespace with the activity
name.

The typespace defaults to the name of the workflow.

## Workflow Variables
The workflow variables are key to how activities are triggered and executed. They can be divided into four categories:

1. Variables given to the workflow engine as parameters
2. Variables that obtain their values using lookup
3. The `context` variable
4. Variables that maps to output of other activities

### context
is a special read-only hash containing contextual information about the currently executing activity such as the
unique identifier for the activity and the currently executing operation (`delete`, `read` or `upsert`).
