Lyra ("lee-ruh") is an open source workflow engine for provisioning and managing cloud native infrastructure. Using infrastructure as code, Lyra enables you to declaratively provision and manage public cloud, private cloud, and any API-requested resources as well as orchestrate imperative actions upon them.
